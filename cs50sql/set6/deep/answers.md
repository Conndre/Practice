# From the Deep

In this problem, you'll write freeform responses to the questions provided in the specification.

## Random Partitioning

This approach prevents the boats from overloading with too much data.
And in case of data loss, the chance to have a backup
But as a disadvantage it carries too much space

## Partitioning by Hour

This approach prevents search queries from being slow by storing data in specific boats
 The observations will be evenly distributed because each one is randomly assigned to any one of the three boats.

## Partitioning by Hash Value

This approach prevents the boats from overloading with too much data
and prevents slowness when trying to find specific data.
But when searching for all data it's likely to be slower because it's needed to hash every value to find data.
